## üí° Learning Tips for Beginners

### 1. **Type Every Example**
Don't just read - type the queries yourself! Muscle memory is real.

### 2. **Make Mistakes**
Errors are your teachers. When you get an error message, read it carefully - it usually tells you what's wrong.

### 3. **Start Small**
Don't try to learn everything at once. Master SELECT before moving to JOINs.

### 4. **Practice Daily**
15-30 minutes daily beats 3 hours once a week. Consistency is key.

### 5. **Build Something Real**
Create a practice database about something you care about - movies, recipes, video games, anything!

### 6. **Ask "Why?"**
Understand the logic, not just the syntax. This guide explains the "why" behind everything.

### 7. **Use the Decision Trees**
Throughout this guide, you'll find decision trees that help you choose the right approach.
