Errors are your teachers. When you get an error message, read it carefully - it usually tells you what's wrong.

### 3. **Start Small**
Don't try to learn everything at once. Master SELECT before moving to JOINs.

### 4. **Practice Daily**
15-30 minutes daily beats 3 hours once a week. Consistency is key.

### 5. **Build Something Real**
Create a practice database about something you care about - movies, recipes, video games, anything!
